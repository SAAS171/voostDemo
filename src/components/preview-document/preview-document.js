                    <ol>

                        <li>You must be allowed to work in the UK to be employed by us and must tell the us immediately if this is not the case. We can end your employment without notice or compensation if you lose or lack permission to work in the UK.</li>
                        <li>You can only work for someone else or hold another business interest if we give you advance written agreement. If you break this rule, we can dismiss you without notice or payment.</li>
                        <li>We can suspend you for a reasonable length of time in the circumstances, to carry out a disciplinary investigation or if we have another reasonable basis for suspension.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                        Our holiday year begins on {documentData.holidayStartDate}. You are entitled to {documentData.holidays} days' holiday per holiday year at your normal basic pay. { documentData.holidayIncluded === "included" ? "This entitlement includes the usual public holidays." : ""} In the holiday year(s) in which your employment starts and ends, one-twelfth of your annual holiday entitlement will accrue for each full month of employment.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        You must take your holidays on dates that are convenient to us and that we agree in writing in advance. You should give us as much notice as you can of your wish to take holiday on a particular date giving notice of at least double the length of time you wish to take on holiday in one go. We may require you to take holiday on specific days as notified to you.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        When your employment ends, we will pay you in lieu of any accrued but untaken holiday entitlement. You must take your outstanding holiday entitlement during any notice period, if we ask you to. If you have taken more holiday than you have accrued then you must repay us for the days you have not accrued. Payment by you or us under this clause will be at the rate of 1/260th of your annual salary (or, if you are part-time, at 1/260th of your full-time equivalent salary) for each day of holiday.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Unless agreed otherwise, if you do not take all of your holiday entitlement in any holiday year, we will not normally make any payment in lieu or increase your holiday entitlement in any subsequent year. However, carry forward may be permitted if a period of extended sickness absence, statutory maternity, paternity, shared parental or adoption leave has prevented you from taking leave in the relevant year and in this case you should contact your line manager or HR representative.

                    </ol>
                    <h3>Sickness</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                        If you are ill or injured and cannot attend work you must tell your line manager or HR representative no later than 30 minutes before your usual start time or as soon as reasonably practicable, unless an extreme emergency does not allow for this. You must provide a reason for your absence.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        If you are off sick for seven days or less in a row, you must complete a self-certification form. If you are off sick for longer, you must give us medical certificates covering the whole period (except the first seven days).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        You must undergo a medical examination by our nominated doctor if we ask you to. We can see any report he writes and discuss the contents with him. We can postpone your return to work following sickness absence until a doctor confirms that you are fit to work.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        During sickness absence, we will pay you Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) as long as you satisfy the relevant requirements. For the purposes of SSP, the agreed qualifying days are your normal days of work as specified in this Agreement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        If your sickness absence is the fault of a third party and you can recover damages from that party you should notify us. If there are any claims or settlements you should keep us informed and pay us back any sum recovered from the third party to compensate you for lost earnings, which you have been paid for by us.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        We have the right to terminate your employment as set out in this agreement even if this means you lose the right to sickness or other benefits.
                        </li>

Our contribution to the Scheme shall be 3% of your qualifying earnings. You may also be required to contribute to the Scheme and you agree to such contributions being deducted from your qualifying earnings, where required. We will notify you of contributions you are required to make from time to time. The Scheme is subject to its rules as may be amended from time to time, and we may replace the scheme with another pension scheme at any time.
